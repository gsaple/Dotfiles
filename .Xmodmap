! default key code 66 -> Capslock, 37 -> Control_L, 105 -> Control_R
clear lock
clear control
clear mod4

! changing CapsLock into Control
keycode 66 = Control_L

! changing Left Control into Windows Key
keycode 37 = Super_L

! changing Right Control into Capslock
keycode 105 = Caps_Lock

add lock = Caps_Lock
add control = Control_L
add mod4 = Super_L Super_R

! as a result, there is an extra Windows key, one less Control key
